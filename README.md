- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Cuma YÄ±ldÄ±z . I graduated from Dokuz EylÃ¼l Faculty of Architecture.
- While doing freelance architecture, I wanted to make a hard landing in the
- software field :) and so I did. I can say that my interest in software and the
- closeness between architecture and software (especially Frontend), things like
- creating my own game and metaverse universe in the future are the reasons that
- attracted me to switch to this field.
